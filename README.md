wysiwyg Rich Editor
Description:

A WYSIWYG editor in React and Typescript using SlateJS
(https://www.slatejs.org/examples/richtext) as the backbone library.

This WYSIWYG editor should allow a user to create a table with any row and column count, enter text into individual cells, justify the text in those cells left, right, or center, and add/remove columns to an existing table.

The resultant SlateJS definition of the WYSIWYG editor’s state should be stored to local storage so on closing and re-opening the window, a user’s editor state is persisted.

Requirements:
• Application uses React and Typescript – can be run on a local machine via “npm install” and “npm run start”
• Testing using your preferred framework – tests should run via “npm run test”
• Styling using your preferred methods
• A user can create a table with a set number of rows and columns
• A user can add or remove rows and columns
• A user can enter text into cells
• The text can be justified left, right, or center within a cell
• Text can be made bold, italic, or underlined within a cell
• WYSIWYG editor state should be saved to local storage, so if a user closes the window, their state is restored upon reopening it
